## 🌟 The Problem We're Solving

### Current Pain Points

**For Players:**
- 😔 Hard to find regular pickup games in their area
- 😔 Don't know who else plays nearby
- 😔 Games often cancelled last minute (not enough players)
- 😔 No record of their stats/improvement
- 😔 Difficult to find Hubs accepting new members

**For Organizers (Hub Managers):**
- 😔 Manual coordination via WhatsApp groups (chaotic)
- 😔 Tracking who's coming/not coming (messy)
- 😔 Balancing teams fairly (time-consuming)
- 😔 Finding new players when regulars can't make it
- 😔 No insights into Hub activity/engagement

**For The Community:**
- 😔 Isolated pickup games with no larger community
- 😔 No way to discover football activity in your city
- 😔 Talent goes unnoticed (no scouting)
- 😔 No platform to share moments/build culture
