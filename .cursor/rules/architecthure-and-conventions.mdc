The project follows a strict modular architecture.

Core principles:
1. Every logical area must be separated into modules with clear responsibility.
2. Use the following structure convention:
   /src
     /modules
       /<moduleName>
         ├─ controllers/
         ├─ services/
         ├─ models/
         ├─ routes/
         └─ utils/
3. All new code must keep this structure.
4. No business logic is allowed inside controllers. Controllers only orchestrate input/output.
5. All logic must be placed inside services with dependency injection patterns.
6. All environment variables must be typed in a dedicated config file.
7. All common utilities go to /src/common/utils.
8. API routes must be explicit, typed, and documented with clear naming.
