Use TypeScript – always strictly typed.
Use ESLint + Prettier conventions with no overrides.
Follow these conventions:
- No default exports.
- No unused imports.
- Always provide return types.
- Prefer pure functions.
- Always add input validation for API endpoints.
- Always use try/catch inside services, never inside controllers.
- All errors must use a unified Error class.
